## Purpose of App
The purpose of English Experience is to give English Language Learners the opportunity to practice English Online, giving them the opportunity to improve their grammar and vocabulary. Currently there are two levels, elementary and intermediate. Students can sign in just using their Google or Facebook accounts. Grammar activities have 10 multiple-choice questions in which they can practice tenses and prepositions, two very difficult parts of the English language to master. Vocabulary activities consist of 15 multiple-choice questions in which users can choose the topic they want to practice, e.g. home, study, tranport, etc. 

In the future, there will be a dashboard that shows the user the date they completed the an activity, its score, number of correct answers and number of incorrect answers.
